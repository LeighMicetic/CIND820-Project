# Abstract

As the average life expectancy for the United States of America continues to increase year over year (from 68.14 years in 1950 to 79.25 years in 2024)(United Nations), an increasing worry for some individuals is what factors contribute to living healthily as we age.   The purpose of this study is to build a predictive model to determine if an individual is aging healthily based on a series of health-related questions.  

## Research Question

Can the number of doctors an individual visits be predicted from questions related to sleeping habits, ratings of physical, dental and mental health, race and gender?

### Dataset

The dataset that will be used for this project was taken from the National Poll on Healthy Aging dataset that was funded by American Association of Retired People (AARP) and Michigan Medicine, the University of Michiganâ€™s academic medical centre. This dataset was previously used by Malani, Preeti N., Jullgren, Jeffrey, and Solway, Erica in 2017.  As the dataset was previously used, missing values have been removed and the original variables have been filtered to the below.  The dataset relied on self-reported measurements from the targeted group.

### Methods

Exploratory data analytics will be performed to better understand the data
Classification algorithms will be used to predict the possiblity of healthy aging with healthy aging being determined by number of doctors visited.  Multiple algorithms will be used and compared to determine the best fit. 

##### Literature Review

Review of academic works that explore the topic of healthy aging and the features that are included in the dataset and the algorithms used by the researchers to analyze their data.
